### Hello, I'm Quentin Ducasse

---

- 🔭 I’m currently working on an Information Flow Tracking system based on LLVM passes and the ARM CoreSight tracing component.
- 🌱 I’m interested in software/hardware security solutions and looking to learn more about their OS integration!
- ⚡ I worked on the RISC-V ISA, extending it for the security of language VMs (such as [Pharo](https://github.com/pharo-project/pharo-vm))
- 🧑‍🎓 I recently defended my thesis intitled "Hardware Security for Just-in-Time Compilation in Language Virtual Machines", you can download the slides [here](https://nuage.cpdt.fr/s/P9JEHPJjgKMfWMm) (in French) or the complete thesis manuscript [here](https://nuage.cpdt.fr/s/4FYnNcXzcTtkWAx) (in English).
