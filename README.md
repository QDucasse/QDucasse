### Hello, I'm Quentin Ducasse

---

- 🔭 I’m currently working on the RISC-V ISA, setting up attacks and defenses, as well as its interaction with languages VMs (such as [Pharo](github.com/pharo-project/pharo-vm)).
- 🌱 I’m interested in software/hardware security solutions and looking to learn more about their OS integration.
- 🧑‍🎓 I recently defended my thesis intitled "Hardware Security for Just-in-Time Compilation in Language Virtual Machines", you can download the slides [here](https://nuage.cpdt.fr/s/bFBrtRSCW8KQL3z) (in French).
